# Appium Sample Framework

## Overview
This repository offers a foundational **Appium-based mobile automation framework** using Java. It supports end-to-end testing of native mobile applications (Android/iOS), organized with clean architecture, modular design, and centralized configuration.

## Key Features
- **Appium-driven UI automation** for native mobile apps  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture for maintainable and reusable code  
- **Maven-based** project structure (`pom.xml`)  
- **Automatic test setup**, including starting/killing Appium server  
- **Allure reporting** for stunning visual test reports (if configured)  
- Emphasis on coding best practices: **KISS**, **DRY**, **OOP**, **static methods**

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Java JDK 8 or above  
- Maven  
- Appium server accessible (and Appium Doctor for validation)  
- Android (.apk) or iOS (.app/.ipa) app under test  
- Emulators or real devices configured and running

## Reports & Logging

Logs are generated per test run and stored under logs/

If Allure reporting is integrated, you can generate and view reports using:

allure serve allure-results


The report opens in your default browser with detailed test breakdowns.
